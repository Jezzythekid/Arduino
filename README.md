# Arduino

Let me start off by saying I am learning.
  Sometimes i give my variables a funny name or a swearword, i'm sorry for that.
  It's my way of learning the programming language.

2nd off, I'm Dutch.
  I am trying to give my variables or comments English names, but if im confused,
  or debugging it helps me to give names in my native language.
  
With that out of the way let me give some background information about this project of mine:

Recently I've bought an Arduino UNO (not the real one but a ELEGOO UNO R3).
Why? Well I dont know, I like to code and this seems fun to me, and so far it is.

If I'm not too lazy I will add notes or comments to my files.

I'll do my best to explain my code as good as i can and i will try to translate the Dutch into
English.

I would really apreciate it if you (the reader) left a comment about my code.
I'd like to know if my code is bad, or has bugs, also if my code can be improved its all a learning curve for me.

Thanks for reading.
